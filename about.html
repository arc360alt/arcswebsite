      <p>Hello! My name is ark, or arc, or arc360, whatever you want to call me, i make gaming videos on youtube, and i code things in html, css, js, and python someitmes too and upload that stuff to my github page, I am also currently running a discord server for my firends and fans, so if you wanna join that, check out the link on the homepage, but im just a normal guy that codes stuff and makes cool things for a living, I am currently on a hiatus from youtube due to a burnout of making so much content (as of may 4th 2025) but i am planning to come back soon so you can check that out if I do, but yeah, i am arc. or ark, or arc360. Also, feel free to talk to me on discord if you have any questions or issues whith my many projects and games (or email me if you prefer that). You can also give me game and video ideas, espesaly ideas for my new game food fight that me and a friend are working on right now. I just got a decently normal life so there isnt much to write about here anymore. well anyway heres my setup specs if you want them.</p>
