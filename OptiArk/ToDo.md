# This update has already been finished.

## A todo list of things that i need to do:

## for Update 1.7:

- Add/Remove:
```diff
- Cull Leaves
- Immedeatly Fast
- More Culling
- WayFix
+ Cubes w/o borders
+ Ksyxis
+ ThreatanGL (When Possible)
+ Change Graphics Settings to Defualt
```

### Reasoning:
- The removed mods Decrease preformance in some cases, so those are going to be removed, and the 3 added mods (1 is allready added) They add QOL stuff and stuff taht impacts preformance.
### Credits:
- Huge thanks to [HexyMC](https://github.com/MrGlitchDogePE) For helping test my modpack on less pwoerful hardware that i dont currently have my hands on. And for reccomending new mods and mods to remove to significantly improve preforamnce:

- Before 1.7: 300-500FPS
- After 1.7: 1500FPS on Defualt 8 chunks and 700FPS on 16.
